Using Kepler's laws of planetary motion, we can calculate the mass of the object they are orbiting.

This is what creates a **quasar** or an **Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)**, some of the brightest objects in the universe. The SMBH itself is dark, but its \"dinner plate\" is blindingly bright.\n",

These large seeds would then have a head start on growing into the giants we see today.\n",

This can **shut down star formation** by depriving the galaxy of the cold gas needed to form new stars. In this way, an SMBH can regulate the size and growth of its own galaxy, preventing it from growing too large.\n",

            "Since black holes themselves don't emit light, we can't see them directly. Instead, we detect them by observing their powerful gravitational effects on their surroundings.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Stellar Orbits:** The most compelling evidence comes from watching stars orbit *something* invisible. At the center of the Milky Way, astronomers have tracked the orbits of individual stars for decades. These stars whip around a central point at incredible speeds (up to thousands of kilometers per second). Using Kepler's laws of planetary motion, we can calculate the mass of the object they are orbiting. The only thing that could be that massive (4 million solar masses) and that compact (invisible) is a supermassive black hole. This work earned the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Accretion Disks:** When gas, dust, and an unfortunate star get too close to an SMBH, they are pulled into orbit, forming a swirling, superheated structure called an **accretion disk**. As the material spirals inward, friction heats it to millions of degrees, causing it to glow intensely across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays. This is what creates a **quasar** or an **Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)**, some of the brightest objects in the universe. The SMBH itself is dark, but its \"dinner plate\" is blindingly bright.\n",

These jets travel at nearly the speed of light and can extend for hundreds of thousands of light-years, far beyond the confines of their host galaxy. They are powered by the intense magnetic fields generated in the spinning accretion disk.\n",

They imaged **M87* in 2019** and our own galaxy's **Sagittarius A* in 2022**.

            "\n",
            "1.  **Stellar Seeds (Hierarchical Growth):** This theory suggests that SMBHs started as regular, stellar-mass black holes. Over billions of years, these \"seeds\" grew by consuming vast amounts of gas and dust and by merging with other black holes during galaxy collisions. This is a slow, bottom-up process.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Primordial Seeds (Direct Collapse):** This theory proposes that in the very early universe, massive clouds of primordial gas could have collapsed directly into a \"direct-collapse black hole\" of tens of thousands of solar masses, bypassing the star phase entirely. These large seeds would then have a head start on growing into the giants we see today.\n",

            "\n",
            "*   **Galaxy Regulators:** The immense energy released by an SMBH's accretion disk and jets can heat up or blow away the gas in the host galaxy. This can **shut down star formation** by depriving the galaxy of the cold gas needed to form new stars. In this way, an SMBH can regulate the size and growth of its own galaxy, preventing it from growing too large.\n",

If they are in the bottom half of the draw, then any player from the bottom half is *impossible*. I can calculate this with this formula `i=65-s` for a seed `s`, where `i` is the first round match number. So, Seed 43 is match number 22.\n",

Since 36 is the highest seed among the options from the same half as 43, it's considered \"most impossible\" to be a runner-up because it should have been eliminated by 43 earlier, rather than being the winner of the other half.

The reasoning, despite its logical flaw in the question setup, is often based on the fact that seed 43 winning implies it beat all stronger contenders in its half to reach the final, and the runner-up is the strongest from the other half. Since 36 is the highest seed among the options from the same half as 43, it's considered \"most impossible\" to be a runner-up because it should have been eliminated by 43 earlier, rather than being the winner of the other half.
